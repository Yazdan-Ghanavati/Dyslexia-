Note: The uploaded code is only the backend of this project and does not contain the frontend components.


## Guideline
So this project is consisted of multiple forms which are basically designed for game level, font size and color and finally working with the database in which user can register or even update their personal info in order to play the game.

## Game play
So basically this program is based on various letters and words in Persian alphabet and the user can set the difficulty on easy, intermediate or hard mode. The logic behind the game is that user will see a word or a letter and based on the set difficulty, they can spend time on reading it and then type that specif word. based on their correct or wrong answers they will get points and that is how they get both induced and motivated in order to perform better and fight back with their disability.
